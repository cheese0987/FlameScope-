# 🔥 FlameScope

**FlameScope** is an interactive wildfire tracking app built with React and Google Maps that empowers firefighters and emergency responders to distinguish between active fire events, assess fire severity by location, and plan strategic suppression deployments.

Designed for clarity and speed, FlameScope visualizes wildfires on a live map and suggests ideal extinguisher or suppression unit placements to support tactical decision-making in the field.

- ⏱️ **Enables faster decision-making**  
  Clickable fire markers display key event data (ID, title, coordinates) in seconds—no spreadsheet needed.

- 🌎 **Supports field navigation**  
  45° tilt and satellite view help identify roads, water sources, buildings, and nearby danger zones.

- 🧯 **Visualizes fire extinguisher/suppression unit placements**  
  Helps responders plan where to stage equipment early for optimal containment.

- 📊 **Lays groundwork for full wildfire intelligence**  
  FlameScope can be expanded to integrate fire spread models, weather overlays, and risk levels.
